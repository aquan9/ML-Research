# ML-Research
 A place for all of my Machine Learning research, past, present, and future.  

Future work: 

I intend to use python to do my research into machine learning as it is my best language thus far.
Specifically I will be working in an implementation of python called Anaconda that includes many of the
requisite modules for the work natively.

Eventually the goal is to make a supervised learning predictive system that is able to train itsself from historical data,
extract relevant features, build a deep neural network, and make a binary prediction to some degree of accuracy.

See the wiki for the papers, theses, and tutorials I will be going through in my research/learning.
